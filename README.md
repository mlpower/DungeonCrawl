# DungeonCrawl
Collaboration space for the Psijic Order - Monster Game

Currently we have a menu system that will give options to the player based on the current surroundings. For example, only certain exit points will be available depending upon the DungeonRoom. The attack option is only available if a monster is present. The player's attributes are limited to hit points, weapon and damage dealt.

The game could be expanded in different ways from here but the most obvious way to expand would be to develop the monster class and include different rooms in the dungeon. If there is time we could also implement treasure chests, traps and keys.
